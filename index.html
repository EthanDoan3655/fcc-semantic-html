        <h1>Aquemini</h1>
        <h4>By Big Boi and Andre 3000</h4>
        <p>Aquemini is the third studio album by American hip hop duo Outkast. 
            It was released on September 29, 1998, by LaFace Records. The title is a portmanteau of the two performers' 
            Zodiac signs: Aquarius and Gemini, which is indicative of the album's recurring theme of the differing personalities 
            of the two members. Aquemini was never an album that defined a specific piece of OutKast's career, but one that captured the duo's entire career in one record. To call it a concept album would be derivative because that would ultimately 
            limit the scope of what OutKast attempted to do. </p>
